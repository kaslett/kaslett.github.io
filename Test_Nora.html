				<p> Welcome! I am a Post-doctoral Associate in the <a href="https://csmapnyu.org/">Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University.</a> 
				I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of Washington (UW) and I am a Fellow for the Political Economy Forum at UW. 
				My fields of study are comparative politics, political economy, and methodology. 
				My research broadly focuses on the effect of technological change and supranational institutions on threats to liberal democracy (specifically fake news/misinformation, populism, and patronage). 
				In addition to this research I have worked to remove obstacles in extracting information from enormous collections of electronic text and images that users encounter online. 
				I have developed applications of machine learning that unlock big and complex data, so that I and others can effectively research the effect of social media on political preferences and opinions. 
				You can track my code and find replication files on <a href="https://github.com/kaslett">Github</a>.
				I have published articles in peer-reviewed journals such as <i>Policy Studies Journal</i> and <i>Europe-Asia Studies</i> and in popular outlets such as the Washington Post. </p>
