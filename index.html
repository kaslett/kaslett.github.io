				My fields of study are comparative politics, political economy, and methodology. 
				My research broadly focuses on the effect of technological change and supranational institutions on threats to liberal democracy (specifically fake news/misinformation, populism, and patronage). 
				In addition, I have worked to remove obstacles in extracting information from enormous collections of electronic text and images that users encounter online. 
				I have published applications of machine learning that unlock big and complex data, so that I and others can effectively research the effect of social media on political preferences and opinions.

							Cracking Open the News Feed: Exploring What U.S. Facebook Users See and Share with Large-Scale Platform Data

	  						</small>
						</h4>

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
						 In this study, we analyze for the first time newly available engagement data covering millions of web links shared on Facebook to describe how and by which categories of U.S. users different types of news are seen and shared on the plat-form. We focus on articles from low-credibility news publishers, credible news sources, purveyors of clickbait, and news specifically about politics, which we identify through a combination of curated lists and supervised classifiers. Our results support recent findings that more fake news is shared by older users and conservatives and that both viewing and sharing patterns suggest a preference for ideologically congenial misinformation. We also find that fake news articles related to politics are more popular among older Americans than other types, while the youngest users share relatively more articles with clickbait headlines. Across the platform, however, articles from credible news sources are shared over 5 times more often and viewed over 7 times more often than articles from low-credibility sources. These findings offer important context for researchers studying the spread and consumption of information — including misinformation — on social media.

						Framing Parkland: A Social Media Approach To Studying Issue Frames And Their Impact 
							<small> 
	  						<br> (with Andreu Casas, Nora Webb Williams, John Wilkerson, and Wesley Zuidema)
	  						<br> Published at Policy-Studies Journal
	  						<br> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psj.12410" target="_blank"> Article </a>	  						</small>
						</h4> 

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
Agenda setting and issue framing research investigates how frames impact public attention, policy decisions, and political outcomes. Social media sites, such as Twitter, provide opportunities to study framing dynamics in an important area of political discourse. We present a method for identifying frames in tweets and measuring their effectiveness. We use topic modeling combined with manual validation to identify recurrent problem frames and topics in thousands of tweets by gun rights and gun control groups following the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, shooting. We find that each side used Twitter to advance policy narratives about the problem in Parkland. Gun rights groups’ narratives implied that more gun restrictions were not the solution. Their most effective frame focused on officials’ failures to enforce existing laws. In contrast, gun control groups portrayed easy access to guns as the problem and emphasized the importance of mobilizing politically to force change.

3.1 Principal Agent Problems Within EU Funds: A Case Study of Patronage in Hungary.  
							<small> 
	  						<br> (with Beatrice Magistro)
	  						<br> Published at Europe-Asia Studies
	  						<br> <a href="./Documents/pa_problems_in_hungary_aslett_magistro.pdf" target="_blank"> Article </a> 
	  						</small>
						</h4> 

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
EU Funds have been linked to high levels of corruption even given substantial levels of administrative and regulatory requirements and extensive domestic monitoring. We posit that this divergence in actual outcomes and preferred policies can be attributed to the co-optation of the auditing and monitoring processes by member state governments. We outline the importance of the auditing process and flow of information to the European Commission using a delegation model and then test what occurs when this process is co-opted in Hungary. We find that the co-optation of the auditing process results in high levels of patronage/corruption.

							Different Channel, Same Strategy? Filling Empirical Gaps in Congress Literature

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
							Political scientists frequently study the public communications of members of Congress to better understand their electoral strategies, policy responsiveness, ability to influence public opinion and media coverage of Congress. However, different studies base their conclusions on different communication channels, including (among others) member websites, newsletters, press releases, and social media. All these scholars have taken these individual sources as fully representative of the communication strategy of the elected official as a whole. However, what has not been asked is whether members communicate the same or different messages across these differing channels? In this paper we look at the member press releases, Twitter, and Facebook messages sent from August to December 2014 in order to study to what extent their communication strategy is consistent across channels. We use an automatic semi-supervised method to classify the messages into political issues and to assess the validity of inferring broader communication patterns from a single source.
